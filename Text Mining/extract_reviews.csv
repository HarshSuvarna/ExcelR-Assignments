    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well...

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

     an excellent set of initial basic things for a child to learn and it is got multiple pages also inside each book I am really impressed. However wait a little before you buy these books, my child is six months old and as with every other thing he was trying to eat this book as well. 🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️🙆🏻‍♀️ But I am keeping the box anyways. 🤷🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️💁🏻‍♀️

    I really liked the books. My 4 month old baby really likes to see the images. Also its travel friendly. I prefer to show him books rather than engaging him with mobile phone.

    I loved the product so much..maybe more than my 1.5 year old daughter😜😁Of course she loved it...The quality of the books are so much high on the mark... The content is so much appealing and informative for age till 3or4...so it can be used for long time.. Even though I was a bit apprehensive of the cost..I realize that The books are worth every penny...

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    If you are reading this space then I would highly recommend you to buy this set. It is so engaging for little babies. With its small size, babies can hold it perfectly and can flip through the pages and can be engrossed in so many varieties of topics.

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size. But if you carefully research , all board books are of this size.Books are very well designed. Corners are kept rounded to avoid accidental hurting to your baby. Content is well researched as well... What more!
